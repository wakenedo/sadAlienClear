## SadAlien - Clear

# A Next.js site with a Native Authoring Experience<!-- omit in toc -->

This version of SadAlien comes with pre-configured schemas and structures for a blog and project pages. It is designed to help developers get started quickly with building their own projects and blogs using the SadAlien style and components. While the project offers pre-configured schemas and structures, it still provides a lot of flexibility for developers to customize and modify the code to their specific needs. This version is well-suited for developers who are comfortable working with pre-configured schemas and structures and want to make modifications to fit their own requirements.

## Features
- Support for block content and the most advanced custom fields capability in the industry
- Webhook-triggered Incremental Static Revalidation; no need to wait for a rebuild to publish new content
- A project with starter-friendly and not too heavy-handed TypeScript and Tailwind.css

## Configuration

### Step 1. Set up the environment

Use the Deploy Button below. It will let you deploy the starter using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-sanity-example) as well as connect it to your Sanity Content Lake using [the Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

### Step 2. Set up the project locally

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) that was created for you on your GitHub account. Once cloned, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and the Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

### Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

When you run this development server, the changes you make in your frontend and studio configuration will be applied live using hot reloading.

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000][localhost-3000]! You can create and edit content on [http://localhost:3000/studio][localhost-3000-studio].

### Step 4. Deploy to production

To deploy your changes to production you use `git`:

```bash
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Alternatively, you can deploy without a `git` hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```
